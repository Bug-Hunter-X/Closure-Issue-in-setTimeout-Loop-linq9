This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript closure issue encountered when using `setTimeout` within a loop. The problem arises because the `setTimeout` callback function doesn't capture the value of `i` at the time it's created, but instead captures a reference to the variable `i`. By the time the `setTimeout` callbacks finally execute, the loop has already completed, and `i` holds its final value (10). This results in the unexpected output of 10 ten times instead of 0 to 9. The solution showcases how to use `let` within the loop to create a new variable scope for each iteration, thus capturing the correct value of `i` for each callback.
